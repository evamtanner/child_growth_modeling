# Code to Implement Nonlinear Modeling to Characterize Child Growth Trajectories
* We use a double logistic model to characterize postnatal growth in infancy and early- to mid-childhood
* Parameter estimates are then used to calculate dynamic growth metrics that can be used for novel application in environmental epidemiology 

## Software Requirements
* SAS 9.4 (14.3)
