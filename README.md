# Nonlinear Modeling to Characterize Child Growth Trajectories
* We use a double logistic model to characterize postnatal growth
* Parameter estimates are then used to calculate dynamic growth metrics that can be used for novel application in environmental epidemiology 

## Software Requirements
* SAS 9.4 (14.3)

## Authors
Eva M Tanner & Chris Gennings, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai

### Collaborators
* Carl-Gustaf Bornehag & Katherine Svensson, Karlstad University, Karlstad, Sweden
